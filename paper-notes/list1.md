1. Spatial Joins in Main Memory: Implementation Matters!

    "This study demonstrates that in main memory, where no time-consuming I/O can mask variations 
    in implementation, implementation details are very important; and it offers a concrete 
    illustration of how it is difficult to make conclusions from empirical running time 
    performance findings in main-memory settings about data structures and algorithms
    studied"

    "Substantial performance gains can be achieved by means of careful
    implementation, to the point that the implementations of the data
    structures and algorithms are more important for the performance
    than the data structures and algorithms themselve"

    "More generally, the results suggest that the empirical study of al-
    gorithms and data structures in main-memory settings, even single-
    threaded settings, is much more challenging than in disk-based set-
