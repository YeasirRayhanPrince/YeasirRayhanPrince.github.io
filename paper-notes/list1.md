1. Spatial Joins in Main Memory: Implementation Matters!

"This study demonstrates that in main memory, where no time-consuming I/O can mask variations 
in implementation, implementation details are very important; and it offers a concrete 
illustration of how it is difficult to make conclusions from empirical running time 
performance findings in main-memory settings about data structures and algorithms
