<H1>FAQs about Online Class</H1>
<p>
1. What is the schedule of our online classes? <br>
The schedule of the classes will remain same as before. <br>
That is CSE 103 Section 10 was scheduled on Sundays and Thursdays at 8:30 am. So the online classes will be held on Sundays and Thursdays at 8:30 am. <br>
That is CSE 103 Section 12 was scheduled on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:00 pm. So the online classes will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:00 pm. <br>
That is CSE 106 Section 3 was scheduled on Sundays and Thursdays at 1:30 pm. So the online classes will be held on Sundays and Thursdays at 1:30 pm. <br>
That is CSE 106 Section 2 was scheduled on Mondays and Wednesdays at 8:30 am. So the online classes will be held on Mondays and Wednesdays at 8:30 am. <br>
That is CSE 205 Section 1 was scheduled on Mondays and Wednesdays at 8:30 am. So the online classes will be held on Mondays and Wednesdays at 8:30 am. <br>

2. Can the schedule of our online classes be changed? <br>
At this moment, NO. As all the other course teacher will hold their online class according to the previous schedule, it will be hard to allocate a new time for this class

3. How will I attend this online class?
It is really easy. All you got to do is follow the following steps.

<i>Firstly</i>, by now you all should have an e-mail account provided by the East West University Authority in the format your_1o_digit_student_id@std.ewubd.edu (e.g. 2011-3-60-128@std.ewubd.edu).
Log in to Google using this mail account.
All sorts of communication with you will be done through your varsity mail. So, please check your mail regularly, especially in the coming days.

<i>Secondly</i>, check your mail first. An invitation has already been sent to join your respective class in Google Classroom. 

If you have somehow missed the invitation, go to the following link: <a href = "classroom.google.com"> click here </a> (Make sure you are logged in with your varsity mail, you can not join this classroom with your personal mail)
And join the classroom using the following class code.[For the class code please email me mentioning your course id, section, student id] 

If you are still having trouble you can have a look at the following links: <a href = "https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/6072460?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en">click here </a>

Now those of you who will be doing this from your android phone, there is an app named Google Classroom in the play store. Download the app and follow the same procedure.

4. I have joined the classroom. Now what?
Now we will conduct our classes via google meet. And how will we do that? 
If you are using a desktop, at the top of your classroom below the course id you will find a <b>Meet link</b>. Click the link and it will redirect you to a new window. If you click <b>join now</b> you will enter the online meeting where we will conduct our classes. 
Now when to join the meeting? - you should join the meeting at your scheduled time according to the routine.
If you are using an android phone, you will find a video-shaped icon which will work as your <b>Meet link</b>. For android users, it will be best to also download the Google Meet app from playstore.

If you have somehow missed all that, please email me mentioning your course id, section, student id for the google meet link.


If you have any questions or you find any difficulty please mail me or you can contact me via mail.
