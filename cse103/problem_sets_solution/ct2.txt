1.	At the start of the semester you all have been assigned a student number, e.g. 2018-1-60-99. If you take a close look at your student id: the first 4 digits represent the year you got admitted into the university, the 5th digit represents the semester(1 means spring, 2 means summer and 3 means fall), the next two digits represent the departmental code(60 is the departmental code of CSE) and last three digits represent the individual id (99) assigned to you.
You will be given an array of size 10 which will contain a student ID. Your task is to write a code to check the validity if a student can take CSE103 course or not. (Mark - 5)
The requirements for taking CSE 103 course:
a.	He must have been admitted in year 2017, 2018 or 2019 
b.	He must be admitted in spring, summer of fall semester
c.	He must be a student of CSE department

Hints: You might have to use flag for solving this problem
NB: Avoid writing code for taking input of the array as it does not hold any mark.

Examples
Input: Output
2 0 1 8 2 6 0 1 1 3	: Valid			
2 0 1 3 2 6 0 1 1 3 : Not valid
2 0 1 8 5 6 0 1 1 3	: Not valid
2 0 1 8 2 7 0 1 1 3 : Not valid

Solution:
int flag = 1;
if(a[0] != 2) flag =0;
if(a[1] != 0) flag =0;
if(a[2] != 1) flag =0;
if(a[3] != 7 || a[3] != 8 || a[3] != 9) flag =0;
if(a[4] != 1 || a[4] != 2 || a[4] != 3) flag =0;
if(a[5] != 6) flag =0;
if(a[6] != 0) flag =0;
if(flag == 0) printf("Not valid");
if(flag == 1) printf("valid");
return 0;

2.	Suppose, a is an array of size n. The following code-snippet performs some manipulations on  the input array a and transforms it. (Mark 2)
        for(i = 0; i <  n/2; i++){
            if(i*2 < n){
                a[i*2] = a[i] * 2;
            }
        }
Your task is to write the output(transformed) array for the following input array
		1	2	3	4	5	6

Solution:
2 2 4 4 8 6
